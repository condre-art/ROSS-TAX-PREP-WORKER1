## COURSE STRUCTURE (9 MODULES)

### Module 1: CLIENT ONBOARDING & INTAKE (2 hours)
**Learning Objectives**:
- [ ] Understand client intake requirements and IRS compliance
- [ ] Gather required client information
- [ ] Verify client identity (KYC procedures)
- [ ] Deliver PTIN disclosure
- [ ] Create client profiles in professional tax software

**Reading Content** (40 pages):

#### Lesson 1.1: Client Intake Essentials

**What is Client Intake?**

Client intake is the first critical step in the tax preparation process. It's where you establish trust, gather essential information, and ensure your firm complies with IRS due diligence requirements. According to IRS Publication 4557 and the rules under Circular 230, tax professionals must:

1. **Verify client identity** - Know who you're representing
2. **Obtain required information** - Income, filing status, dependents, prior-year returns
3. **Deliver PTIN disclosure** - Inform clients of your preparer identification number
4. **Document consent** - Secure authorization for representation and e-filing
5. **Establish communication** - Provide secure intake portal and contact methods

**Why It Matters**: Poor intake leads to:
- Missing income sources → IRS examination
- Incorrect filing status → Penalties
- Duplicate dependents → Credit disqualification
- Unsigned authorizations → e-file rejections
- Compliance violations → Loss of PTIN, fines

**Case Study 1.1A: The $5,000 Mistake**

A preparer accepted a client without verifying prior-year information. The client claimed a dependent who was already claimed by an ex-spouse. Result:
- IRS rejected the return for duplicate dependent
- Client Tax Credit (CTC) was disallowed
- Preparer issued corrected return (delay)
- Amended return filed 6 months later
- Client lost potential refund

**Prevention**: Always cross-check prior-year returns and obtain written consent for dependent claims.

---

#### Lesson 1.2: Client Intake Workflow

**Step 1: Welcome & Orientation**
- Client receives welcome email with expectations
- Portal login credentials provided
- Security notice and data privacy statement
- Estimated timeline (intake to filing)

**Step 2: Information Questionnaire**
Collect:
- Full legal name, SSN, DOB
- Filing status (single, married, HOH, QW, MS)
- Spouse information (if applicable)
- Dependent names, SSNs, relationships, months lived in home
- Address (primary residence and any other addresses)
- Contact information (email, phone)
- Prior-year AGI or balance due
- Occupation and employment status

**Step 3: Document Upload Checklist**
Client uploads:
- Photo ID (driver's license, passport, state ID)
- Proof of citizenship (birth certificate, passport copy)
- Prior-year return (for reference)
- Marriage certificate (if MFJ or HOH with dependent)
- Divorce decree (if MS with dependent support)
- Any other relevant documents

**Step 4: Identity Verification**
Your firm's procedures should include:
- Name-to-SSN match (using third-party verification service)
- Address verification (USPS confirmation)
- Photo ID review (check expiration, authenticity)
- Prior-year return cross-check (filing status, AGI, SSN matches)

**Example Verification Checklist:**
```
CLIENT: John Michael Smith
SSN: 123-45-6789
DOB: 01/15/1980

☐ Name-to-SSN match: VERIFIED
☐ Address on file: 456 Maple St, Austin, TX 78701
☐ Prior-year filing status: Single (2024)
☐ Prior-year AGI: $65,000
☐ Photo ID expiration: 03/15/2027 (VALID)
☐ Citizenship verified: Yes
☐ PTIN disclosure: Delivered 02/03/2026
☐ Risk level: LOW
```

**Step 5: PTIN Disclosure**

You MUST provide this disclosure before accepting representation:

---

**PREPARER TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (PTIN) DISCLOSURE**

Tax Return Preparers are required to provide this disclosure to all clients:

*"I am a tax return preparer registered with the Internal Revenue Service. My PTIN is [XXX-XX-XXXX]. My credentials are [CPA/EA/Enrolled Agent/Tax Preparer]. I am subject to the IRS rules of professional conduct under Treasury Circular 230. This means I must:*

- *Act with competence, integrity, and professional care*
- *Keep your tax information confidential*
- *Avoid conflicts of interest*
- *Provide accurate advice to the best of my knowledge*
- *Respect your rights and represent your interests*

*If you have concerns about my conduct, you may contact the Office of Professional Responsibility at (202) 927-0932 or submit a complaint at www.irs.gov.*"

---

**Internal Tasks for Module 1:**

```
☐ Client Profile Created
  - File name: LastName_FirstName_SSN_TaxYear
  - Location: Secure client folder in tax software
  - Access: Restricted to assigned preparer + reviewer

```

---

#### Lesson 1.3: Special Situations in Client Intake

**Scenario A: Head of Household Filing Status**

If client claims HOH, verify:
- [ ] Marital status (unmarried, legally separated, or divorced as of 12/31)
- [ ] Qualifying dependent (child, parent, or other qualifying person)
- [ ] Dependent lived in home >50% of year
- [ ] Client paid >50% of household expenses
- [ ] Dependent's SSN and relationship documented
- [ ] Dependent is U.S. citizen, resident alien, national, or Canadian/Mexican resident

**Common Error**: Client thinks she qualifies for HOH because she pays rent. HOH requires a qualifying dependent OR dependent parent, not just living alone.

**Scenario B: Married Filing Separately**

If client claims MFS, document:
- [ ] Spouse's full name and SSN
- [ ] Reason for MFS (separated, tax planning, other)
- [ ] Itemized deductions (not available for all clients if spouse itemizes)
- [ ] Dependent custody and support
- [ ] Community property state considerations

**Tax Planning Note**: MFS often results in higher tax due to unfavorable phase-outs. Recommend MFJ unless there's a compelling reason (separation pending, tax liability from spouse, etc.).

**Scenario C: Non-Citizen Spouse**

If spouse is NRA (Non-Resident Alien), verify:
- [ ] Valid visa/immigration status
- [ ] ITIN obtained (if applicable)
- [ ] Filing status must be MFS or MFJ + ITIN election
- [ ] Income from U.S. sources documented
- [ ] Treaty benefits (if applicable)

### Module 2: DOCUMENT COLLECTION & VALIDATION (2 hours)
**Learning Objectives**:
- [ ] Organize income documents (W-2, 1099s)
- [ ] Identify missing or incomplete documentation
- [ ] Request corrections and follow up
- [ ] Flag data inconsistencies
- [ ] Maintain audit trail of communications

**Reading Content** (40 pages):

#### Lesson 2.1: Income Document Requirements

**W-2 Forms: Employee Income**

**What is a W-2?**
Form W-2 reports wages paid by an employer during the tax year. The employer withholds federal, state, and FICA taxes.

**Key Boxes on W-2:**
- **Box 1**: Wages, tips, other compensation (taxable income)
- **Box 2**: Federal income tax withheld
- **Box 3**: Social Security wages
- **Box 4**: Social Security tax withheld
- **Box 5**: Medicare wages and tips
- **Box 6**: Medicare tax withheld
- **Boxes 12-Y**: Codes for special items (retirement contributions, HSA, etc.)

**Critical Verification Points**:
```
☐ Employee name on W-2 matches SSN provided
☐ SSN matches what client provided
☐ Employer name and EIN match records
☐ Box 1 wages match client's understanding
☐ Federal withholding reasonable (5-25% of gross)
☐ State income tax withheld (if applicable to state)
☐ No duplicate W-2s for same employer
☐ All W-2s received by January 31st
```

**Common W-2 Errors**:
1. **Wrong SSN** - If employer entered incorrect SSN, IRS will reject
2. **Name mismatch** - Name on W-2 must match SSN record
3. **Duplicate W-2s** - Same employer, two W-2s (entry error)
4. **Missing Form 1098-T** - Educator deduction (Box 12 Code D)
5. **Excess withholding** - Correct excess via Form W-4 with employer

**Case Study 2.1A: The $3,000 Withholding Problem**

Client received W-2 with $35,000 wages and $8,500 federal withholding. She knows she only made $32,000.

**Issue**: Employer likely entered incorrect wages or applied incorrect withholding rate (24% vs. 12%).

**Solution**:
1. Contact employer's payroll department
2. Request W-2-c (corrected W-2)
3. If withholding is excessive, client will receive larger refund
4. Advise client to adjust W-4 with employer for next year

---

#### Lesson 2.2: 1099 Forms & Self-Employment Income

**Types of 1099s:**

| Form | Type of Income | Examples |
|------|---|---|
| 1099-NEC | Non-employee compensation | Contractor, freelancer, consultant |
| 1099-MISC | Miscellaneous income | Rent, royalties, prize winnings |
| 1099-INT | Interest income | Bank savings, bonds, CDs |
| 1099-DIV | Dividend income | Stock dividends, mutual funds |
| 1099-B | Brokerage sales | Stock/bond sales, capital gains |
| 1099-K | Payment card sales | Credit card, PayPal, Square transactions |
| 1099-R | Retirement distributions | IRA, 401(k), pension withdrawals |
| 1099-SSA | Social Security benefits | SSA payments |

**1099-NEC: Independent Contractor Income**

**Key Requirements**:
- [ ] Recipient name and SSN must be correct
- [ ] Box 1 (Non-employee compensation) = gross amount received
- [ ] Issued by January 31st
- [ ] Payer name and EIN required
- [ ] Two copies: one for recipient, one for IRS

**Self-Employment Tax Implications**:
- 1099-NEC income is subject to self-employment tax (15.3% combined = 12.4% Social Security + 2.9% Medicare)
- Must file Schedule C (Profit or Loss from Business) with Form 1040
- Self-employment tax calculated on Schedule SE
- Quarterly estimated tax payments may be required

**Critical Questions for 1099 Income**:
1. What business expenses did you incur? (supplies, equipment, mileage, software)
2. Did you have a home office? (home office deduction, depreciation)
3. Did you pay independent contractors? (if >$600, issue 1099-NEC to them)
4. What equipment purchases did you make? (Section 179 deduction, depreciation)
5. Did you have business meals, travel, professional development?

---

**1099-K: Merchant Card & Third-Party Network Payments**

**Important Update (2025)**: IRS is phasing in 1099-K reporting:
- 2025+: Transactions >$600 reported (threshold lowering over time)
- Previously: >$20,000 AND >200 transactions

**Common Sources**:
- Stripe, Square, PayPal
- Venmo, Cash App (peer-to-peer payments)
- Amazon, eBay seller payments
- Payment processor invoicing

**Key Issue**: 1099-K includes both business AND personal payments (refunds, transfers between accounts, personal Venmo payments). **You MUST reconcile 1099-K with actual business income.**

**Reconciliation Template:**

```
1099-K Amount Received:           $15,000

Less: Personal Transfers          ($2,000)
Less: Refunds to Customers        ($1,000)
Less: Business Reimbursements     ($500)

Actual Business Income:            $11,500
```

   - Verify taxpayer name, SSN, address
   - Check spouse information (if MFJ)

2. **Enter Dependent Information**
   - Name, SSN, DOB, relationship
   - Months lived in home (>6 months required for most credits)
   - Citizenship status
   - Residency status
   - Verify each dependent is not claimed by another taxpayer

3. **Income Entry**

---

#### Lesson 3.2: Common Data Entry Errors

**Error 1: Wrong Filing Status**

| Actual Status | Entered As | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Single with dependent child | Single | Missing HOH eligibility → Higher tax |
| Married, separated 11/30 | MFJ | Invalid status (must be MFS or single) |
| HOH | MFJ | Inflates standard deduction → Overpayment |
| Widow(er) | MFJ | Only valid for 2 years after death |

**Prevention**: Verify filing status early. For dependent claims, confirm relationship, residence, and age.

---

**Error 2: Missing or Duplicate Dependents**

**Scenario**: Client forgot to include teenage son because he was in college.

**Issue**: Son earned $8,000, so he's not a qualifying dependent (>$4,700 gross income limit), BUT:
- Client can still claim him as a dependent based on age <24, full-time student
- Son should file his own return (small refund likely)
- Son may qualify for education credit

**Prevention**: Review household members, ages, relationships, income, and residence before finalizing.

---

**Error 3: Capital Gains Entry Mistakes**

Client sold stocks and received Form 1099-B with:
- Proceeds: $15,000
- Cost basis: $12,000
- Gain: $3,000

**Common Mistake**: Entering $15,000 as income instead of $3,000 gain.

**Correct Entry**:
- Short-term gain (< 1 year): Taxed as ordinary income
- Long-term gain (≥ 1 year): Preferential rate (0%, 15%, or 20%)
- Must report on Schedule D

---

#### Lesson 3.3: Schedule C: Self-Employment Income

For clients with 1099-NEC or business income, use Schedule C.

**Section A: Business Information**
- [ ] Business name
- [ ] Business code (NAICS code)
- [ ] Accounting method (cash or accrual)
- [ ] Business address
- [ ] Business start date
- [ ] Employees? (Yes/No)

**Section B: Income**
- [ ] Gross receipts/sales (Box 1a on 1099-NEC)

Common deductions:
- **Advertising**: $X
- **Car/truck expenses**: Standard mileage (67.5¢/mile 2025) or actual
- **Depreciation**: Equipment, vehicles, furniture (Form 4562)
- **Office supplies**: Pens, paper, software
- **Rent/lease**: Office space, equipment rental
- **Repairs/maintenance**: Equipment repairs (not improvements)
- **Utilities**: Electric, internet, phone
- **Travel**: Hotels, airfare (local travel not deductible)

- **Home office**: $5/sq ft × sq footage (limited to income) or actual expenses
- **Professional services**: Accountant, attorney, consultant fees
- **Taxes**: Business licenses, payroll taxes (NOT income taxes)

**Important**: Expenses must be:
- Ordinary (normal for that business)
- Necessary (helpful and appropriate)
- Reasonable (not excessive)
- Business-related (not personal)
- Documented (receipts, invoices, mileage logs)

**Section D: Net Profit or Loss**

- Client claims Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)
- Client claims Child Tax Credit (CTC)
- Client claims American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)

**Key Verification Points on Form 8867:**

1. **Earned Income Definition**
   - Wages, salaries, tips (W-2)
   - Self-employment income (Schedule C)
   - Nanny wages if filing Schedule H
   - Does NOT include interest, dividends, capital gains, unemployment

   - Relationship: Child, stepchild, adopted child, or sibling
   - Residence: Lived with taxpayer >50% of year
   - Citizenship: U.S. citizen, national, or resident alien
   - SSN: Valid social security number (not ITIN for CTC)

3. **Income Limits**

   - CTC phases out at different thresholds ($1 per $100 over limit)
   - Must verify income calculation

4. **Investment Income Limit**
   - EITC not available if investment income > $11,000 (2025)
   - Must exclude capital gains in this test

---

#### Lesson 4.3: Common Red Flags in Returns

**Red Flag 1: Excessive Business Loss**

**Scenario**: Client claims $85,000 consulting income but $92,000 in deductions (net loss $7,000).

**Questions to Ask**:
1. Is the business truly operating at a loss?
2. Were there large one-time purchases (equipment, vehicle)?
3. Are expenses inflated or personal expenses included?
4. Is there a pattern of losses (hobby loss rules)?

**Hobby Loss Rules**: If business has losses for 3+ years out of 5, IRS may classify as hobby. No deduction allowed for hobby losses.

**Correct Approach**: Verify each expense with documentation. Ask client if they have records.

---

**Red Flag 2: Discrepancy Between W-2 Box 1 and Wages Reported**

Client received W-2 with $45,000 but tells you to enter $42,000 (difference is bonuses she's claiming on different return).

**Issue**: W-2 is official document. IRS expects you to report W-2 amount.

**Correct Approach**: Enter $45,000 as shown on W-2. If bonuses are deferred or belong to next year, get documentation.

---

**Red Flag 3: Dependent Age Mismatch**

Client claims 18-year-old as dependent, but also claims she's a full-time student (should be stated on return).

**Questions to Ask**:
1. What college does she attend?
2. Is she enrolled full-time for the calendar year?
3. Who paid her support (client >50%)?
4. Did she have income (if so, how much)?

**Correct Entry**: If full-time student, can claim until age 24 (if meets other requirements).

---

#### Lesson 4.4: Signature & Authorization Requirements

**Preparer Signature Requirements**:

Per IRS rules, you MUST:
1. **Sign the return** - Handwritten or digital signature
2. **Include PTIN** - Your preparer identification number
3. **Include credentials** - CPA, EA, Enrolled Agent, or "Tax Preparer"
4. **Date the signature** - Date return is signed
5. **Include firm information** - Name, address, phone (if applicable)

**Example Signature Block:**
```
Preparer's signature: _________________________
Date: ___________

Print name: James Smith
PTIN: 456-78-9012
Credentials: Enrolled Agent (EA)
Firm name: Ross Tax Academy LLC
Phone: (512) 489-6749
```

---

**Form 8879: IRS e-File Authorization**

Before e-filing, client MUST sign Form 8879.

**Key Information on Form 8879**:
- [ ] Taxpayer SSN
- [ ] Tax year
- [ ] Return type (1040, 1120, 1041, etc.)
- [ ] Preparer information
- [ ] Preparer signature and credentials
- [ ] Declaration: "Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined the tax return and the information I provided"
- [ ] Taxpayer signature (electronic or handwritten)
- [ ] Date

**Critical**: Client MUST sign Form 8879 before transmission. No signature = No e-filing.

---

2. Request payment plan (Form 9465-FS)
3. Reduce balance by claiming additional deductions (if available)

---

#### Lesson 5.2: Form 8879 & E-Filing Authorization

**What is Form 8879?**

Form 8879 is the IRS e-File Authorization. It allows the IRS to accept your return electronically. Client MUST sign it before transmission.

**Key Points to Explain to Client:**

"Form 8879 is a legal authorization that says:
- You have reviewed your tax return
- The information is true and complete
- You authorize us to send it to the IRS electronically
- You understand penalties for false statements may apply

**You must sign this form before we can file your return.**"

---

#### Lesson 5.3: Addressing Client Concerns

**Common Client Questions:**

**Q1: "Why do I owe taxes if I had withholding?"**

**A**: "Your employer withheld based on your W-2 income. However, you also had self-employment income from your consulting work. The total tax on both income sources is higher than what was withheld. This is normal for self-employed people."

---

**Q2: "Can I claim my sister as a dependent?"**

**A**: "Only if she meets certain requirements:
1. She lived with you for the entire year
2. She's a U.S. citizen or resident alien
3. She earned less than $4,700 in 2025
4. You provided more than 50% of her support
5. She's not a dependent of someone else"

---

**Q3: "Why can't I claim my adult daughter?"**

**A**: "Adult dependents must meet the income test (under $4,700) and residency test (lived with you >50% of year). If your daughter lived elsewhere, she doesn't qualify as your dependent."

---

**Practice Assignment 5.1: Client Communication**

*Scenario*: Client reviews return and questions:
1. "Why is my self-employment tax so high?"
2. "Can I claim my home office deduction?"
3. "What if I can't pay the full amount?"

**Your Tasks**:
1. Draft explanation for each question
2. Provide calculations supporting your answers
3. Create a follow-up email if client needs to provide additional information

---

#### Lesson 6.2: IRS MeF (Modernized e-File) System

**What is MeF?**

MeF is the IRS's modern system for receiving e-filed tax returns. It replaced the older EFILE system.

**How MeF Works**:

1. **Submission** - Your tax software encrypts the return and sends to IRS MeF
2. **Receipt** - IRS confirms receipt within seconds (generates submission ID)
3. **Processing** - IRS processes the return (20-48 hours)
4. **Acknowledgment** - IRS sends back acceptance or rejection code
5. **Status** - You can check status in your software

**Important**: MeF uses secure encryption. Your client's sensitive data is protected.

---

**Transmission Status Codes:**

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| Received | IRS has it | Check status tomorrow |
| Processing | Under review | Wait 24-48 hours |
| Accepted | IRS will process | Return is approved |
| Rejected | Error found | Review error code & correct |
| Pending | Awaiting manual review | No action needed |

---

#### Lesson 6.3: Common Transmission Errors

**Error: "Duplicate SSN - Dependent Already Claimed"**

**Cause**: Dependent claimed by multiple taxpayers (e.g., divorced parents both claiming same child).

**Solution**:
1. Contact other taxpayer or their preparer
2. Verify who has custody/qualifies
3. Remove dependent from one return
4. Re-transmit

---

**Error: "Refund Amount Does Not Match Bank Account"**

**Cause**: Bank routing number or account number incorrect.

**Solution**:
1. Verify bank account number with client
2. Obtain correct routing number (9-digit code)
3. Contact bank if uncertain
4. Correct information and re-transmit

---

**Error: "AGI Does Not Match Prior Year"**

**Cause**: AGI from 2024 return doesn't match what IRS has on file.

**Solution**:
1. Review 2024 return
2. Confirm 2024 AGI is entered correctly
3. If AGI was amended, use amended AGI
4. Re-transmit

---

#### Lesson 6.4: E-Filing Best Practices

**Batch Timing**:
- File early in season (January 15+) to avoid congestion
- Avoid filing in last week before deadline (paper backlog risk)
- File weekday business hours (avoid midnight submissions)

**Error Handling**:
- Check transmission status within 24 hours
- If rejected, identify error code immediately

- Keep detailed log of all submissions and corrections

**Client Communication**:
- Notify client return was filed successfully
- Explain 21-day refund timeline
- Provide tracking ID for their records
- Set expectations for refund date

**Reading Content** (30 pages):

#### Lesson 7.1: Common Rejection Scenarios

**Scenario 1: SSN Mismatch (Error Code 400)**

**What Happened**: You entered client SSN as 123-45-6789 but IRS records show 123-45-6788.

**Investigation**:
- Ask client to confirm SSN
- Check all source documents (W-2, prior returns, ID)
- Verify against SSA records if available

**Correction**:
- Update SSN in return
- Verify all dependents' SSNs match their 1099s/W-2s
- Re-transmit

**Note**: If client's name doesn't match SSN, IRS will reject. Ensure name-SSN match before transmission.

---

**Scenario 2: Invalid Bank Account (Error Code 622)**

**What Happened**: Routing number is 9 digits but you entered 8 or 10.

**Investigation**:
- Ask client which bank
- Verify routing number (9 digits)
- Confirm account number (8-12 digits)
- Test with small deposit first (if needed)

**Correction**:
- Re-enter correct routing and account numbers
- Double-check digits
- Re-transmit

---

**Scenario 3: Duplicate Dependent (Error Code 650)**

**What Happened**: Both parents claimed same child (divorced situation).

**Investigation**:
- Contact client
- Determine who qualifies (custody, support, prior agreement)
- Identify other taxpayer's SSN if possible

**Correction**:
- Remove ineligible dependent
- Document reasoning (e.g., "Custody with other parent")
- Re-transmit

---

#### Lesson 7.2: Rejection Timeline & Client Communication

**Subject: Your Tax Return Status – Correction Needed**

Dear [Client Name],

We e-filed your 2025 tax return on February 3, 2026. Unfortunately, the IRS returned the return with a request for correction. Here's what happened:

**Reason for Rejection:**
The IRS could not match your Social Security number to their records. This sometimes happens if there's a typo or if the SSA hasn't updated its system yet.

**What We're Doing:**
We have verified your correct SSN with you (it is 123-45-6789) and corrected the return. We will re-file it today.

**What to Expect:**
- New submission ID: [2026020315XXXXX]
- New processing time: 24-48 hours
- You should see "Accepted" status by tomorrow

**Next Steps:**
Please confirm your contact information remains:
- Phone: [client phone]
- Email: [client email]
- Direct deposit account: [last 4 digits]

If you have questions, call us at (512) 489-6749.

Best regards,
