## CHAPTER 1: UNDERSTANDING IRS EXAMINATION PROCESS (28 pages)

### 1.1 What is an IRS Audit?

**Definition**: An examination is an IRS review of tax return accounts to determine whether they comply with tax laws.

**Why IRS Examines Returns**:
1. **Compliance**: Verify taxpayer followed law
2. **Revenue**: Identify underreported income or improper deductions
3. **Norm Setting**: Use audit results to educate taxpayers about proper reporting
4. **Deterrence**: Audit selection itself deters non-compliance

---

### 1.2 Types of Examinations

**Three Categories** (by scope):

**1. Correspondence Audit**
- IRS contacts taxpayer by mail only
- Usually limited to specific items
- 30-40% of all audits
- Common for: Missing deductions, documentation issues, math errors
- Timeline: 30 days to respond to IRS letter
- Taxpayer rights: Can request conference; can have CPA/EA represent via correspondence

**Advantages**:
- Less intrusive than office audit
- Faster resolution
- Can be conducted entirely by mail/phone

**Disadvantages**:
- Limited opportunity to explain complex issues
- May feel impersonal

---

**2. Office Audit**
- Taxpayer/representative comes to IRS office
- Specific items examined
- Typically 10-15 business days
- Common for: Self-employed returns, Schedule C, real estate investors
- Can expand in scope if IRS finds additional issues

**Preparation**:
1. Review IRS letter for specific items
2. Organize documents chronologically
3. Prepare summary/analysis documents
4. Brief client on what to expect
5. Attend with representative if possible

---

**3. Field Audit**
- IRS auditor comes to business location
- Extensive examination of books and records
- 1-3 weeks typically, can extend
- Common for: Large business returns, complex transactions
- Can examine multiple years

**Scope**: Entire return may be examined, not just specific items

---

### 1.3 Examination Timeline

**From Selection to Closure**:

**Day 1-5**: **Initial Contact**
- Audit notice mailed (IRS Notice)
- Specifies items under examination
- Lists documents needed
- States examination deadline (typically 30 days)

**Day 6-30**: **Information Gathering**
- Request documents from client
- Organize responses
- Prepare analysis documents
- Identify weak/strong positions

**Day 31-60**: **Examination Conduct**
- Attend office audit or field audit
- Answer IRS questions
- Provide documentation
- Note any additional requests

**Day 61-90**: **IRS Analysis**
- Auditor reviews information
- Calculates proposed adjustments
- Prepares audit report

**Day 91-120**: **Closing Conference**
- Final meeting with auditor
- Discuss findings
- Options presented:
  * Accept examination result
  * Request Appeals
  * Disagree (dispute notice)

---

### 1.4 Audit Selection Criteria

**How IRS Selects Returns**:

**1. Computer Screening** (DIF - Discriminant Function Score)
- Returns scored on mathematical model
- Higher-risk returns flagged automatically
- Accounts for: Income level, deduction ratios, prior audit results

**2. Matching Program**
- Form 1099 income vs. return reported income
- W-2 wages vs. return reported wages
- Helps identify underreported income

**3. Random Selection** (Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program)
- Small percentage selected randomly
- Helps IRS maintain examination pressure across all groups

**4. Related Audit** (Grouping)
- Related taxpayers examined (partnerships, S-corps, related entities)
- Coordinated exam approach

**5. Specific Issue Audits**
- IRS focuses on particular industry or transaction
- Example: Real estate flipping, cryptocurrency, conservation easements

---

### 1.5 Common Audit Triggers (Red Flags)

**High-Risk Items** (likely to be examined):

**Income Issues**:
- Significant year-to-year income decrease
- Business income far above/below industry norms
- Unreported 1099 income
- Multiple 1099 forms from same payer

**Deduction Issues**:
- Home office deduction
- Vehicle expense claims (high mileage)
- Meals & entertainment >50% of gross income
- Charitable contributions >20% of AGI
- Professional fees and taxes as excessive % of income

**Self-Employment Issues**:
- Schedule C loss (business loss) every year
- Expense-to-income ratio unusual (too high expenses for revenue)
- Large depreciation or Section 179 deductions
- Related-party transactions

**Filing Issues**:
- Filing status inconsistency year-to-year
- Dependent claims that change annually
- Multiple returns filed for same year

---

### 1.6 Documentation Standards

**IRS Requires** (to support return positions):

**For Income**:
- Copies of W-2 forms (or employer letter)
- 1099 forms (all types: NEC, MISC, INT, DIV, K)
- Bank statements showing deposits
- Business records (invoices, contracts, payment records)
- Explanation of how income calculated

---

**For Expenses**:
- Original receipts or invoices
- Credit card statements
- Bank statements
- Cancelled checks
- Contemporaneous written acknowledgment (for charitable gifts)
- Mileage logs (vehicle expenses)
- Appointment books (time allocation for home office)

**What IRS Will NOT Accept**:
- Reconstructed records
- Bank statements alone (without supporting documents)
- Oral testimony without backup
- Estimates (must be actual records)
- Credit card statements without supporting receipts

---

### 1.7 Common Examination Issues & Resolution

**Case Study 1.1: Missing Deduction Documentation**

**Scenario**:
Sarah claimed $8,500 in office supplies and professional fees on her Schedule C. IRS auditor requested documentation. Sarah couldn't locate original receipts but provided credit card statements showing charges to office supply stores.

**IRS Position**: 
Documentation insufficient. Credit card statement doesn't prove what was purchased or business purpose.

**Resolution**:
1. Sarah provided credit card statements (evidence of transaction)
2. Reviewed IRS Publication 587 (home office guidelines)
3. Made reasonable estimate based on business type
4. Provided explanation letter for adjustment

**Outcome**: 
Auditor allowed 50% of claimed amount based on reasonable estimate. Partial adjustment of $4,250 sustained.

---

**Key Learning**: 
Credit card statements show *that* a transaction occurred, but receipts show *what* was purchased and *why* it's deductible.

---

### 1.8 Study Questions

**Q1: Audit Type Selection**

A business received notice of IRS examination. The letter states examination will occur at the taxpayer's place of business and will include all books and records. What type of examination is this?

A) Correspondence audit
B) Office audit
C) Field audit
D) Random selection audit

**Answer: C** - The reference to taxpayer's business location and "all books and records" indicates field audit.

---

**Q2: Common Documentation Error**

Which is the MOST serious documentation weakness in a self-employment audit?

A) Credit card statements without receipts
B) Copies of invoices instead of originals
C) No records at all for claimed expenses
D) Bank deposits lacking supporting invoices

**Answer: C** - No documentation at all cannot be reconstructed, whereas other issues might be supported through alternate evidence (bank records, credit card statements, reconstructed logs with supporting evidence).

**End of Chapter 1**

## CHAPTER 2: TYPES OF AUDITS & EXAMINATION SELECTION (26 pages)

### 2.1 Correspondence Audit Details

**When Used**:
- Primarily for individual returns with single issues
- Mathematical errors on return
- Missing forms or schedules
- Discrepancies between reported and matched income (1099 forms)

**IRS Form Used**: 
- Notice 556 (Examination of Returns, Appeal Rights, and Claims for Refund)
- Often includes: Notice 886-A (explanation of specific adjustments)

**Process**:
1. IRS mails examination notice with specific items and deadline (usually 30 days)
2. Taxpayer responds by deadline with requested documents
3. IRS reviews correspondence
4. Issues report with findings
5. If agreed, sends notice of deficiency

**Key Points**:
- All communication via mail/phone
- No in-person meeting
- Can still request Appeals hearing
- Representation allowed (CPA/EA can respond in taxpayer's place)

---

**Example: Correspondence Audit**

**Date**: May 15, 2025
**Notice**: Request for information regarding 2024 return, Schedule C
**Items**: Business mileage deduction claimed $6,200

**IRS Request**:
- Contemporaneous mileage logs for 2024
- Method for calculating business mileage percentage
- Explanation of business purpose for vehicle

**Response Required**: June 15, 2025

**Taxpayer's Response Options**:
1. Provide mileage logs (if maintained)
2. Provide evidence that business mileage logs were kept (appointment books, calendar, route records)
3. Provide reconstructed estimate with supporting evidence (if no logs)
4. Request extension if more time needed

## SPECIAL SECTION: PENALTY MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Reasonable Cause Defense

**When Applicable**:
Accuracy-related penalty (20%) or failure-to-file penalty (5%) can be abated if taxpayer shows "reasonable cause" and "good faith."

**Elements of Reasonable Cause**:
1. Taxpayer exercised ordinary care and prudence
2. Appropriate reliance on professional advice
3. Complexity of tax law
4. Prior audit history
5. Taxpayer's education level and experience

**Documentation Required**:
- Letter from CPA/EA explaining position
- Explanation of how return prepared
- Evidence of reliance on professional
- Copies of supporting documents

---

### Case Study: Successful Penalty Abatement

**Facts**:
- Client claimed home office deduction
- Failed to maintain contemporaneous mileage logs (vehicle)
- IRS proposed accuracy-related penalty
- Deficiency: $4,200 + Penalty: $840

**Taxpayer's Reasonable Cause Argument**:
1. Client engaged CPA to prepare return
2. CPA provided guidance on documentation requirements
3. Deduction was legitimate (80% business use verified)
4. Only documentation issue was mileage logs
5. Client had no prior audit history

**IRS Decision**:
Penalties abated. Allowed deduction based on reconstructed mileage estimates with supporting evidence (appointment books, business records showing customer visits).

**Lesson**: 
Even with documentation issues, reasonable cause can prevent penalties if taxpayer relied on professionals and made good-faith effort to comply.
