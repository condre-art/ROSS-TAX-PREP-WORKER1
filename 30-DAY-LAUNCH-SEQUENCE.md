### Facebook Strategy

- **Share** Instagram content (reels + posts)
- **Create** native Facebook carousel ads (see below)

- **Join** local community groups, answer tax questions naturally

### X/Twitter Strategy

- **Thread:** "5 things that will delay your refund" (build authority)

Sample X Threads:

```
🧵 5 Things Slowing Down Your Refund

1. Wrong banking info (most common!)
   → We verify before filing
   → Catches 90% of refund issues

2. Missing documents
   → 1099s, W2s, SSA letters
   → Our intake lists everything you need

3. Name mismatch with IRS
   → Marriage? Name change?
   → Fix BEFORE filing

4. Identity verification delays
   → IRS wants to confirm you're you
   → Speeds up with proper info

5. Processing backlog
   → Can't control this one
   → But direct deposit helps

Bottom line: We eliminate 80% of delays.
