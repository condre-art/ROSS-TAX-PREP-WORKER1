## CHAPTER 1: INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX FUNDAMENTALS (25 pages)

### 1.1 Defining Income & Taxable Income

**What is Income?**

For federal tax purposes, income is "all income from whatever source derived" unless specifically excluded by law (IRC §61).

**Types of Income**:

1. **Earned Income**
   - Wages and salaries (W-2)
   - Self-employment income (1099-NEC, Schedule C)
   - Bonus payments
   - Commission income
   - Tips and gratuities

2. **Unearned Income**
   - Interest (1099-INT)
   - Dividends (1099-DIV)
   - Capital gains (Form 1099-B, Schedule D)
   - Rental income (Schedule E)
   - Passive activity income (Form 8582)

3. **Other Income**
   - IRA distributions (1099-R)
   - Social Security benefits (1099-SSA)
   - Unemployment compensation (1099-U)
   - Gambling winnings (Form W2-G)
   - Prizes and awards

---

**Taxable Income Calculation**:

```
Gross Income (all sources)                    $100,000
Less: Above-the-line deductions               ($6,000)
= Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)                 $94,000

Less: Standard or itemized deduction          ($14,600)
= Taxable Income                              $79,400
```

---

### 1.2 Filing Status & Impact on Tax

**Five Filing Statuses**:

**1. Single**
- Unmarried on last day of tax year
- Not qualifying for HOH or QW
- Standard deduction: $14,600 (2025)

**Example**: John, never married, earns $45,000 wages.
- AGI: $45,000
- Standard deduction: $14,600
- Taxable income: $30,400
- Tax liability: ~$3,200

---

**2. Married Filing Jointly (MFJ)**
- Married on last day of tax year
- Both consent to filing jointly
- Only one return filed for both spouses
- Standard deduction: $29,200 (2025)
- Generally results in lowest tax

**Example**: Maria and her spouse earn $70,000 combined.
- AGI: $70,000
- Standard deduction: $29,200
- Taxable income: $40,800
- Tax liability: ~$4,100 (lower than filing separately)

---

**3. Married Filing Separately (MFS)**
- Married but filing separate returns
- Often results in HIGHER tax
- May have benefits in specific situations (spousal liability, separate entity situations)
- Standard deduction: $14,600 each
- Some credits not available

**When to Consider MFS**:
- Spouse has significant tax liability you don't want to be responsible for
- Separation or divorce is pending
- State community property issues
- Legitimate tax planning strategy

**Important**: Default is MFJ. MFS requires specific reason.

---

**4. Head of Household (HOH)**
- Unmarried as of December 31
- Pays >50% of household expenses
- Has qualifying dependent living in home >50% of year
- Standard deduction: $21,900 (2025)
- More favorable rates than single

**Qualifying Dependents for HOH**:
- Child, stepchild, or adopted child (any age if related)
- Parent (can live outside home)
- Sibling, stepsibling, or their children
- Any other relative who is a citizen/resident alien and lived with you

**Does NOT qualify**: Unrelated persons living in home, non-citizen relatives

**Example**: Sarah, single parent with one child.
- Can file HOH if child lived with her >50% of year
- Standard deduction: $21,900 vs. $14,600 (single)
- Tax savings: ~$900+ depending on income

---

**5. Qualifying Widow(er) (QW)**
- Spouse died within 2 prior years
- Unmarried and not remarried
- Had dependent child living in home
- Standard deduction: $29,200 (same as MFJ)
- Only available for 2 years

**Example**: Robert's wife died in 2023. They had one child.
- 2024-2025: Can file as QW
- 2026+: Must file as single or HOH (if still qualifies)

---

## CHAPTER 2: GROSS INCOME & EXCLUSIONS (25 pages)

### 2.1 W-2 Wages & Employee Income

**Form W-2 Components**:

Employers must issue W-2 by January 31 for wages paid during the tax year.

**Key Boxes** (and what to enter on return):

| Box | Description | Form 1040 Line |
|-----|---|---|
| 1 | Wages, tips, other compensation | 1a (Wages) |
| 2 | Federal income tax withheld | Calculation |
| 3 | Social Security wages | Schedule SE |
| 4 | Social Security tax withheld | Calculation |
| 5 | Medicare wages and tips | Schedule SE |
| 6 | Medicare tax withheld | Calculation |
| 12 | Codes (D, E, F, G, H, S, Y, etc.) | Varies by code |

---

**Box 12 Codes** (Common):
- **D**: 401(k) contributions (reduces taxable wages)
- **E**: 403(b) contributions (reduces taxable wages)
- **F**: 403(b) earnings
- **G**: Elective salary reduction
- **H**: Employer HSA contributions
- **J**: Nontaxable section 83(b) election
- **S**: Employee Social Security tax on tips
- **Y**: Deferrals under section 409A (nonqualified plans)

---

**Example: W-2 Wage Calculation**

Jennifer's 2025 W-2:
- Box 1 (Gross wages): $65,000
- Box 12-D (401(k) contribution): $7,000
- Box 12-E (403(b) contribution): $3,000
- Box 2 (FIT withheld): $8,200

**Tax Return Entry**:
- Gross wages: $65,000 (entered as-is, even though she contributed to 401(k))
- 401(k) is pre-tax, so already reduced in Box 1
- Federal withholding: $8,200 (will offset tax liability)

---

### 2.2 Self-Employment Income (1099-NEC)

**What Qualifies as Self-Employment Income**:

Income from a trade or business, including:
- Independent contractor work
- Freelance consulting
- Rental of equipment
- Business activities with profit motive

**Reported on**: Form 1099-NEC (non-employee compensation)
- Box 1: Total compensation
- Issued by January 31

---

**Self-Employment Tax**:

Self-employed individuals pay both employer and employee portions of FICA taxes (15.3% combined):
- Social Security: 12.4% on wages up to $168,600 (2025 limit)
- Medicare: 2.9% on all wages
- Additional Medicare: 0.9% on wages over $200,000 (single)

**Calculated on**: Net self-employment income (Schedule C profit minus certain deductions)

---

**Example: Self-Employment Tax**

David, freelance consultant, had:
- Gross consulting income: $50,000
- Business expenses: $12,000
- Net self-employment income: $38,000

**Self-Employment Tax**:
1. Net self-employment income: $38,000
2. × 92.35% (employer's portion adjustment): $35,093
3. × 15.3% self-employment tax rate: $5,369
4. Deductible SE tax (half): $2,685

**Tax Return**:
- Schedule C shows $38,000 net profit
- Schedule SE calculates $5,369 SE tax
- Can deduct $2,685 as above-the-line deduction
- Net impact of SE tax: $2,684 (after deduction)
