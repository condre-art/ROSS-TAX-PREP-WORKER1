## Incident Response Plan

**Purpose:**
To ensure rapid, coordinated, and transparent response to outages, security incidents, or data breaches affecting the ROSS Tax Prep platform.

### 1. Detection & Initial Response
- Uptime monitoring alerts (via UptimeRobot, StatusCake, or Pingdom) are sent to the engineering and compliance leads.
- Any staff member noticing an issue must immediately notify the incident response lead.

### 2. Assessment & Containment
- Incident response lead assembles the response team (engineering, compliance, communications).
- Assess scope, impact, and risk. Contain the incident (e.g., disable affected services, rotate credentials).

### 3. Communication
- Update the public status page (status.html) with incident details and estimated resolution time.
- Notify all affected clients via email and SMS.
- Escalate to IRS, payment processors, or legal counsel if required.

### 4. Resolution & Recovery
- Resolve root cause, restore all services, and monitor for recurrence.
- Document all actions taken and lessons learned.

### 5. Post-Incident Review
- Conduct a post-mortem with all stakeholders.
- Update policies, training, and technical controls as needed.
